## What We Contribute?

**TL;DR:** :one: A real2sim pipeline to quantitatively digitalize a real-world lithography system into a high-fidelity neural lithography digital twin; :two: A fully-differentiable bi-level design-manufacturing co-optimization framework to bridge the design-to-manufacturing gap in computational optics.

<summary>To expand, this work answers two questions in computational optics (including computational lithography).</summary>


### This work answers two fundmental questions in computational optics (including computational lithography):
1. *What is the "elephant in the room" in Computational Lithography?*
  - **High-fidelity photolithography simulator.** | "No matter how good we can advance the computational (inverse) lithography algorithm, the performance bound is grounded in the fidelity of the lithography simulator."  
  
2. *What hinders the progress of end to end differentiable design computational optics?*
  - One should be the **Design to Manufacturing gap**. | "Yes you can design a perfect lens, but you cannot guarantee the post-manufacturing performance."

### Accordingly, our work tackles the above questions and opens up two exciting research directions:

1. Real2Sim learning for 3D modelling the fabrication outcome of any real-world photolithography system.

2. Close the Design-to-manfuctuting gap via co-optimizing the manufacturiability and the task design with two intersected differentiable simulators (Litho + Task).
