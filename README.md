### This work answers two fundmental questions in compuational optics (including comp litho):
1. What is the "elephant in the room" in Computational Lithography?
  - How to construct an **accurate photolithography simulator**.
2. What is the most urgent problem that hinders the progress of computational optics?
  - The **Design to Manufacturing gap**: Yes you can design a perfect lens, but you cannot guarantee the post-manufacturing performance. 


### Accordingly, our work opens up two exciting research directions:

1. Real2Sim learning for 3D modelling any real-world photolithography system

2. Close the Design-to-manfuctuting gap via co-optimizing the manufacturiability and the task design from two intersected differentiable simulators (Fabrication + Task)
